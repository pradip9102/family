# Meet The Family

## Problem context
Our story is set in the planet of Lengaburu......in the distant, distant galaxy of Tara B.And our protagonists are King
Shan, Queen Anga & their family.

King Shan is the emperor of Lengaburu and has been ruling the planet for the last 350 years (they have long lives in
Lengaburu, you see!). Letâ€™s write some code to get to know the family.

This coding problem is for backend and fullstack developers and tests object oriented fundamentals.

## Features
+ Given a 'name' and a 'relationship', output the people corresponding to the relationship in the order in which they were added in the family tree.
+ Add a child to any family in the tree through the mother.

## I/O Format
| Format | Input | Output |
|:-------|:------|:-------|
| *Recreate planet | `LENGABURU [king_name] [queen_name]` | `PLANET_CREATED` |
| Add a child | `ADD_CHILD [mother_name] [child_name] [gender]` | `CHILD_ADDITION_SUCCEEDED` |
| *Marriage | `MARRIAGE [husband_name] [wife_name]` | `MARRIED` |
| Find related people | `GET_RELATIONSHIP [person_name] [relationship]` | `[[name_1]...]` |

## Sample I/O scenarios
| Sample | Input | Output |
|-------:|:------|:-------|
| 1. | `LENGABURU Shan Anga` | `PLANET_CREATED` |
| 2. | `MARRIAGE Chit Amba` | `MARRIED` | 
| 3. | `ADD_CHILD Pjali Srutak Male` | `PERSON_NOT_FOUND` |
| 4. | `GET_RELATIONSHIP Pjali Son` | `PERSON_NOT_FOUND` |
| 5. | `ADD_CHILD Asva Vani Female` | `CHILD_ADDITION_FAILED` |
| 6. | `GET_RELATIONSHIP Vasa Siblings` | `NONE` |
| 7. | `GET_RELATIONSHIP Atya Sister-In-Law` | `Krpi Satvy` |

## Supported relationships
Simple relationships: Father, Mother, Sibling, Child

Composite relationships: others

| Relationships | Description |
|:--------------|:-----------|
| `Paternal-Uncle` | Father's brothers |
| `Maternal-Uncle` | Mother's brothers |
| `Parental-Aunt` | Father's sisters |
| `Maternal-Aunt` | Mother's sisters |
| `Sister-In-Law` | Spouse's sisters, Wives of siblings |
| `Brother-In-Law` | Spouse's brothers, Husbands of siblings |
| `Son` | |
| `Daughter` | |
| `Siblings` | |
| *`Brother` | |
| *`Sister` | |

## Assumptions
+ A new token `LENGABURU` is being used to reset the system, which simply introduces king and queen to the system during
 initialization to keep things simple. [e.g. `LENGABURU Shan Anga`]
+ `LENGABURU [king_name] [queen_name]` must be the first command to the system.
+ Adding new child without mother name should be allow with a wilcard(?) mother name. [e.g. `ADD_CHILD ? Aria Female`]
